# Tars
Tars is an App that helps NIRBHAYA SQUAD(Maharastra Police's Special Unit for Women Safety) to patrol more efficiently across the state so that they don't 
miss any blind spot to cover for women safety. Moreover it helps to provide an outstanding result towards maintaing women safety. 
## Problem
Safety of Women in India has become a major issue in India now. The crime rates against women in the country have only risen to a great extent. Moreover 
when they face any unwanted situation like this they hardly inform the police station which is only 1.6 km far from her. Even though NIRBHAYA SQUAD is there to prevent this but it is very hard for them to cover the whole city. For that reason their always remain some blind spot and culprits use those chances.  
## How Tars would solve it:

When a woman faces any uncomfortable situation she can just scream "Help!", using several machine learing models and computational linguistic this app will
inform the nearest patroling police vehicle. Moreover the app will also provide exact real time location of the girl so that police can reach the place as soon as possible.
The app will also give a efficient strategy to patrol seamlessly across the state. It will direct them where to stay, when to patrol and where to patrol 
to cover the whole city with minimum amount of police vehicle. Moreover it will notify them if there any blind spot left. If the app identify any blind
spot, it will give co-ordinates to the police vehincle so that the blind spot can be covered.
